## üìù Brief

This project implements a novel **image encryption algorithm** that addresses the limitations of traditional chaotic systems. While low-dimensional chaotic systems suffer from limited key space and weak security, and high-dimensional ones are too complex and inefficient, this method introduces a **stable and secure alternative**.

Key innovations include:
- **Chaotic Jumping Mechanism**: Utilizes random switching between two uncorrelated 1D chaotic maps to eliminate linear correlations.
- **Parallel DNA Encoding Groups**: Dynamically forms encoding groups and executes multiple encryption results in parallel.
- **Stability-Driven Optimization**: Selects the most stable ciphertext output from multiple candidates to reduce instability.
- **High Security and Robustness**: Demonstrates strong resistance to plaintext attacks and suitability across diverse image types and sizes.

This approach achieves **enhanced security**, **high sensitivity to input**, and strong **applicability in real-world image encryption scenarios**.
